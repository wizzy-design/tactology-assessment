# Frontend Developer Assignment – Roster System

---

We want to evaluate your **React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Chakra UI skills** in a real-world scenario.

You will be implementing a Roster **System** based on this [**Figma design**](https://www.figma.com/design/Ao4TVJNXKKrmY1lU0ZqnEd/TGLOBAL-FRONTEND-ROSTER-ASSIGNMENT?node-id=0-1&t=sjpWCuBMZOAst08h-1) . This is **not for production use** – we have already built this internally. The goal is to test your ability to take a design and turn it into a working app.

## 🔧 Tech Stack Rules

You **must use only** the following:

- **Next.js** (latest stable version)
- **TypeScript**
- **Chakra UI** and/or **Ark UI**
- **iconsax-reactjs** for icons
- **react-icons** for any additional icons

❌ **AI-generated code is strictly not allowed**.

## 🎯 Requirements

1. **Follow the Figma design closely.**
    - Implement the layout exactly as provided.
    - Proper use of Chakra/Ark UI components.
2. **Todo List Functionality**
    - Display a  calendar view with  data
    - Ability to switch to the next data
- Clicking on a schedule should show the details popup
3. **UI/UX**
    - Use icons (iconsax/react-icons) as shown in the design.
    - Show empty states and loading states where appropriate.
    - Keep the UI consistent with Chakra/Ark UI best practices.

## ⭐ Bonus (Optional, but highly valued)

- Ability to drag and drop users on the calendar and they are scheduled
- Month view for the planner
- switching between live & plan view should load different date
## 📂 Deliverables

- A GitHub repository with your code.
- You can also host your solution on vercel or similar platforms
- Clear commit history (not a single commit dump).
- `README.md` with setup instructions.

## ⏳ Timeline

The task is designed to take about **2-3 days**.
## ✅ What We’re Testing

- **React/Next.js fundamentals** – state management, component structure, routing (if needed).
- **TypeScript usage** – typing props, models, and functions properly.
- **Chakra/Ark UI skills** – layout, responsiveness, and clean design implementation.
- **Icons integration** – using iconsax-reactjs and react-icons correctly.
- **Coding style & structure** – clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- **Attention to detail** – following the Figma design, handling edge cases.
- **Bonus problem-solving** – live table updates and persistence.
